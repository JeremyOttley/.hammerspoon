** Usage

You should definitely check out `init.lua` for the full "how to use" experience. That's where
all of the usage is defined, after all. For a brief breakdown though, here's what does what:

*** "hyper" refers to pressing <kbd>⌘ + ⌥ + ⌃ </kbd> at once.
*** "hyperShift" refers to pressing <kbd>⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ </kbd> at once.
